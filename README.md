Authentication Options
----------------------

Horizon Session
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The `Monasca Horizon plugin`_ offers Horizon integration for Monasca.
Among other things this plugin proxies the Monasca metrics API, using
the Horizon session for authentication (as opposed to a Keystone token).
This proxied API can be used to let this plugin access the Monasca API
with the privileges of the user logged in to Horizon.

Note that this is entirely separate from Grafana’s user management.

Setting this up requires the following steps:

1. Install and configure the ``monasca-ui`` Horizon plugin. Specifically
   you will need to set ``GRAFANA_URL`` to ``/grafana`` and point
   ``GRAFANA_LINKS`` to your dashboards which can either be JSON
   dashboards you point to or in-database dashboards. In the former case
   set the links’ ``raw`` attribute to ``True`` and their ``path``
   attribute to the dashboard’s path or full URL. In the latter case,
   set the links’ ``raw`` attribute to ``False`` (or omit it entirely)
   and set their ``path`` attributes to the database dashboards’ names.

2. Enable ``mod_proxy`` and ``mod_proxy_http`` in Apache:

   ::

      a2enmod proxy proxy_http

3. Configure the VHost hosting your Horizon instance with a proxy path
   that points at your Grafana instance (the example assumes you are
   running Horizon on Apache - adapt as required for other web servers):

   ::

      ProxyPass "/grafana" "http://my.grafana.server:3000"
      ProxyPassReverse "/grafana" "http://my.grafana.server:3000"

4. Configure Grafana’s ``[server/root_url]`` setting to point at your
   dashboard node’s ``/grafana`` path:

   ::

      [server]
      root_url = %(protocol)s://%(domain)s/grafana

5. Configure the plugin as follows:

   -  Http settings:

      -  Url: ``http://my.dashboard.server/monitoring/proxy``
         (substitute your dashboard’s actual host name for
         ``my.dashboard.server`` here)
      -  Access: direct

   -  Authentication

      -  Auth: Horizon

Steps (2) and (3) are neccessary to ensure both Grafana and Horizon are
on the same Host/Port from the browser’s perspective. Otherwise the
browser’s XSS protection mechanisms will omit the Horizon session cookie
from any requests triggered by the ``monasca-grafana-datasource``
plugin.

Keystone Authentication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When combined with Grafana Keystone authentication this datasource
supports using login credentials to authenticate queries.

Keystone Token
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Without the Grafana Keystone auth, this datasource can be used by
inserting a keystone token into the datasource. To get a keystone token
download the python-openstackclient, source credentials and run
``openstack token issue``.
